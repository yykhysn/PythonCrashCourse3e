""" To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple empty projects and 
look at what Django creates. Make a new folder with a simple name, like tik_gram 
or insta_tok (outside of your learning_log directory), navigate to that folder 
in a terminal, and create a virtual environment. Install Django and run the 
command django-admin.py startproject tg_project . (making sure to include the 
dot at the end of the command). Look at the files and folders this command 
creates, and compare them to Learning Log. Do this a few times, until youâ€™re 
familiar with what Django creates when starting a new project. Then delete the 
project directories if you wish. """


# I have done it in terminal

# Using below commands:
""" 
python -m venv character_18
mv 18-1_New_Projects.py character_18
cd character_18
source bin/activate
django-admin startproject character_18_project .
ls
