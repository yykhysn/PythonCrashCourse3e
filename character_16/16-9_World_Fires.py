""" In the resources for this chapter, youâ€™ll find a file called 
world_fires_1_day.csv. This file contains information about fires burning in 
different locations around the globe, including the latitude, longitude, and 
brightness of each fire. Using the data-processing work from the first part of 
this chapter and the mapping work from this section, make a map that shows which 
parts of the world are affected by fires. You can download more recent versions 
of this data at 
https://earthdata.na sa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data.
You can find links to the data in CSV format in the SHP, KML, and TXT Files 
section. """
